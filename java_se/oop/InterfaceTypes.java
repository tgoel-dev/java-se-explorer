	/*
	 * Special Interface types:
	 * 
	 * 1. Mixins - interfaces that provide additional capabilities. Naming
	 * convention: "*-able". ex: Comparable, Sharable.
	 * 
	 * 2. Markers - interfaces with no methods/fields; simply used for organization.
	 * ex: RandomAccess, Serializable.
	 * (+) esp. useful with instanceof use.
	 * 
	 * 3. Functional Interface - an interface with a single abstract method. 
	 * A requirement for Functional Programming (discussed later). 
	 * 
	 * // Prefer using standard functional interfaces, instead of custom ones.
